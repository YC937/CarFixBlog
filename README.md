# Travel Blog

This is Coding Bootcamp Project 2 by Group 8.

It is an online Blog to store my photos and texts. 

## Concept

As a traveler I WANT to store photos and what I think about the places I have visited.

It‚Äôs DONE when I create an account and upload my texts/photos to my travel blog website.

## User Story

THEN the website will tell me to login or sign up first.

WHEN  I login or sign up after typing the username and password.
THEN I am presented with the List of blogs I posted before.

WHEN I click the Post a new blog button.
THEN I am presented with a page where I can create a new post by texting and uploading pictures. 

WHEN I click the ‚Äúcreate‚Äù button.
THEN It will save to the list of posts.

WHEN I click one of the posts in the list.
THEN I am presented with the page for me to update or delete that post.
